# Green Supermarket Online Shopping Application

Welcome to the Green Supermarket Online Shopping Application repository! This project was developed as part of the Software Engineering 2 module in the second year, first semester. The application is designed to serve the imaginary company, Green Supermarket, and provide users with a seamless online shopping experience.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- JSP (JavaServer Pages)
- Servlets
- Relational Databases
- Azure Web Services

## Architecture
We followed the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to ensure a well-organized and modular design. This separation of concerns allows for easier maintenance and scalability.

## Key Features
Our application incorporates several key features to enhance user experience and security:

- **Password Hashing**: We prioritize user security by implementing robust password hashing mechanisms.
- **Backend Server-Side Validations**: To ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized access, we implemented server-side validations.
- **SMTP Mail Service**: Customers who place orders receive confirmation emails thanks to our integration with an SMTP mail service.
- **PayPal Sandbox**: As a secure and widely used payment gateway, we integrated the PayPal sandbox for smooth and reliable transactions.

## Hosting and Security
Thanks to GitHub Student Developer benefits, we were able to get a domain for one year for free and access Azure services without cost. Leveraging Azure, we learned how to deploy and host our entire site. To ensure security, we used Cloudflare to obtain an SSL certificate, making our website secure for users.
